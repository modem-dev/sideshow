# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A session thread at the bottom of each session in the viewer: a composer
  for messaging the agent without picking a snippet.
- Feedback now reaches agents without polling: publish/update/reply responses
  carry a `userFeedback` array with any comments the user left since the
  agent's last call (delivered once; a consumed `wait` also counts as seen).
- The design guide, setup block, and Claude Code skill teach the background
  watch pattern: arm `sideshow wait` as a background process after publishing
  and react when it exits, instead of blocking or polling.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Comments not attached to a snippet (e.g. `sideshow comment` without
  `--snippet`) were stored and delivered to agents but never shown in the
  viewer; they now render in the session thread.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- `sideshow demo` seeds two example sessions (a sequence diagram with a
  comment thread, an interactive explainer, a metrics card) so the viewer can
  be explored without an agent.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-11

First release.

### Added

- Initial release: live preview surface (Hono server + single-file viewer)
  with sessions, versioned snippets, and comment threads.
- Zero-dependency `sideshow` CLI: `serve`, `publish`, `update`, `wait`,
  `comment`, `list`, `sessions`, `guide`, `setup`. Sessions resolve
  automatically per agent conversation.
- Stdio MCP server with `publish_snippet`, `update_snippet`,
  `wait_for_feedback`, `reply_to_user`, `list_snippets`, `get_design_guide`.
- Long-poll feedback endpoint (`GET /api/comments?wait=N`) so terminal agents
  can block on user comments without extra infrastructure.
- Agent design contract served at `/guide`; paste-able AGENTS.md integration
  block at `/setup`.
- Sandboxed snippet rendering (`sandbox="allow-scripts"`, CSP CDN allowlist)
  with light/dark theme CSS variables and a `sendPrompt`/`openLink` bridge.
- Cloudflare Workers deployment (`npm run deploy`): the whole app runs in a
  Durable Object with SQLite storage; local and cloud are the same product
  behind `SIDESHOW_URL` + `SIDESHOW_TOKEN`.
- Built-in MCP over streamable HTTP at `/mcp` on every server (local and
  deployed) — agents can connect without any local process.
- Token auth for deployed instances: bearer header for APIs, `/?key=<token>`
  cookie flow for the viewer; `/guide` and `/setup` stay public.
- Claude Code skill at `skills/sideshow/` teaching agents the publish →
  feedback → iterate workflow.
